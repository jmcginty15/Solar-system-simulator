# Solar System Explorer

Solar System Explorer is a web app built to realistically depict the motions of the planets and moons of our solar system. It is [deployed and available for viewing through Heroku](https://solar-system-simulator.herokuapp.com/).

## Features

Solar System Explorer includes a total of 223 solar system bodies available for viewing, including the Sun, 8 planets, 5 dwarf planets, and 209 total moons. The user can select one of 13 preselected sets of bodies along with a date and time, and the app populates a simulated three-dimensional space with the selected set of bodies at their real positions relative to the solar system barycenter at the selected date and time.

Using these selected positions as a starting point, the app is capable of simulating and animating the motions of the selected solar system bodies in space. This is done according to realistic Newtonian mechanics and the gravitational interactions between all bodies in the simulation. The user can select a name from a list of bodies currently in the simulation to center the view on that object.

## Standard User Flow

User selects a set of objects from the list.
